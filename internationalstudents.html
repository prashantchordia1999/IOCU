<b>First Time Managers</b><BR>
It’s essential for a new manager to transition into an effective leader from an individual contributor. This can be achieved by understanding personal leadership styles, setting goals, prioritising and creating a collaborative environment that engages people. A first time manger needs to practice situational leadership that can help him exercise overall responsibly for a task while being able to delegate, motivate and manage conflict using effective communication.<br></p><p style="font-size: 13px; text-align: justify;">
<b>Middle Management</b><br>
Middle managers often lead individual contributors and managers who lead other teams. They are an essential link between the company vision and the diverse workforce.  This is achieved through self management in order to build trust and empathy within and outside the organization. A clear coaching and feedback mechanism while being culturally sensitive and a strong understanding of business dynamics will help lead high performing teams. <br><br>



<b>Individual Contributors</b><br>
These individuals need to be able to influence without being in a formal position of authority.  Effective communication and interpersonal skills coupled with the ability to plan and organize will help in the delivery of consistent results.<br><br>

<b>Executive Management</b><br>
Executive leaders are at the helm of the organization. They demonstrate a strong ability to lead people using a charismatic and inspirational style of leadership. They should be experts at identifying potential conflict situations and resolve them using strategic thinking. Taking sound decisions  or risks based on facts and data will help build and motivate strong cross functional teams. Fostering an environment of collaboration and engagement will help build a strong workforce and enhance service outcomes to all stakeholders.<br><br>

<p class="c">Regardless if you present in person, on the phone, or over the Web, the way you present yourself and your message is critical to your success. It’s all about personal brand, message and reputation these day!  So, whether you want to be a thought leader, sales person, marketing professional, online business celebrity, trainer or conference speaker, knowing how to present your ideas, thoughts and message in a compelling and engaging way is critical to business success.
<br>
        <br>
Public speaking is one of the key things that thought leaders, business leaders and entrepreneurs need to do more and more these days. So, whether you’re looking to run <strong> small and intimate workshops</strong> with clients or you’re wanting to <strong> speak in front of hundreds or thousands</strong> of people, we’ll work together to get you there.
