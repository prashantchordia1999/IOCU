    <strong>CHRIST (Deemed to be University) International Profile</strong>
    <br><br>
In its quest for achieving World Class University standards, Christ ( Deemed to be University) strives to identify, adapt and put into effect the best educational and administrative practices .It has signed more than 90 MOU’s with Foreign Universities for exchange of students and teachers, conduct joint research and publication, programmes, organize joint seminars and conferences etc.<br><br>
Regular exchange of  students  under various schemes  like duel degrees, twinning arrangements are arranged with about 15 active Universities in U.S.A, UK, Europe, Korea and Australia. Every year  about 200 students are exchanged for study periods extending from a few weeks to 2 semesters between Christ University and the partner Universities abroad.
Christ University is the only University adopted by the 25 member Universities Study Abroad Consortium (USAC) of U.S.A for hosting short term U.S students in India. For this purpose Christ University maintains specialized units with qualified staff to run these exchange programmes.<br><br>
Besides  hosting exchange students for short periods , Christ University  admits  around    250  foreign students every  year to its regular  programmes .At present , about 600 foreign students from more than 55 Asian ,African, European and North American countries are on the regular rolls  of the University.<br><br>
The International Office of the University has, over the years, evolved an elaborate system to make admissions easier. A student from abroad has the facility to apply online  through the University website and selection interviews are conducted over telephone /Skype and thereafter provisional admission letters and visa instructions are sent to the student without the hustle of travelling.
Annual  subscriptions  are taken for two International internet magazines  viz  Daijiworld.com(Dubai) and Masterstudies.com(Norway) as a means of informing international students about the University.<br><br>
Concessional tuition fees  are offered for the nationals of SAARC and African countries to encourage education with Christ ( Deemed to be University) .A 3 month intensive English Language Course is organized every year in the months of March to May (before the commencement of regular courses) for students coming from non English Learning backgrounds  to equip them with our teaching methodology.
The International  Office makes arrangements to receive and accommodate the new admitted foreign students and  also assists with registration with the local Foreigners Regional Registration office .<br><br>
Christ ( Deemed to be University)  strives  integrate the diverse international student community with the mainstream Christ University campus culture  by organizing   annual welcome get together and exclusive orientation programmes . Special medical attention is also provided through the medical staff .
The International office acts as a mentor by monitoring the academic progress of the International students with the help of teachers and counselors. It also encourages and applauds merit students by giving awards and prizes for securing distinctions in semester examinations, part scholarships/fee concessions for higher studies,etc.<br><br>
As a policy , foreign students are encouraged to opt for higher studies at our University and also remain in touch with International office even after completion of their studies. Graduates are encouraged to join the Alumni Association units in their respective countries <br>.Informal Christ University Alumni Association units are being formed  in countries like Thailand, Nepal, Maldives, and South Korea.<br><br>
There seems to be good appreciation for the work undertaken by the International  Office of the University in a few countries abroad as for example ,Government of Maldives sponsors a few of their official candidates for study at Christ University every year. Also, the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia has started placing their sponsored candidates at Christ University for higher studies from this year onwards.<br>
