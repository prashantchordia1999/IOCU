Immersive Learning is a word that has created a lot of buzz in recent years. It is however quite easy to misunderstand fundamental interactive and participative learning as immersive learning.<br>
Through our HiFi programs, participation and learning gradually evolves in an immersive environment, where you're not playing a series of disconnected games but you are engaged in one or two life-like scenarios which have many separate and disparate components to it. It's a simulation of sorts -based on your actions, you discover key information that has the potential of changing the way you handle the situation.<br>
Moreover, while you evolve your strategy and approach on how to handle the situation based on your understanding of it, the scenario is also evolving based on several external influencers. We place people and outcomes at the center of content-driven experiences. Let’s look at some of our most widely recognized programs.
