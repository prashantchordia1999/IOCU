A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at https://codepen.io/mirichan/pen/jEBmyG.

 This interactive map is built without any scripting at all. It was built originally for MTi Group's [new site](http://mtigroup.com.au/distribution). It has been adapted slightly for this demo. The SASS is a little messy as a result of the hasty port - it was once part of a much larger file.

Thanks a bunch for the featured post!! â™¥
